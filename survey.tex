\section{Introduction}
  % Indicates the large scale and the upcoming importance of IoT
  \IEEEPARstart{C}{urrent} technology trends in the the fields of information technology and communication networks have been focusing their attention on the so-called \emph{Internet of Things}---commonly referred to as \emph{IoT}. The term was first used in 1999 to describe the futuristic idea of autonomous computers that were able to gather information from the real world and take particular actions based on it, without any intervention of a human being \cite{Ashton2009}. Nowadays, the further development of Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks (WS\&AN), as well as the improvement of mobile computing, enables the necessary infrastructure for sustaining a state where everyday objects would interact between each other in order to take smart decisions without the need of the human physical factor.

  Several technology companies and institutes with renowned international reputation, have stated the the \emph{IoT} represents an important business opportunity. Gartner includes it as one of the top ten technology trends of 2013 \cite{Gartner2012}, while Cisco predicts that the Value at Stake of the \emph{IoT} will be \$14,4 for companies and industries in the next ten years \cite{JosephBradley2013}. The public sector will also be affected; traffic and pollution control, among others, will be enhanced under the concept of smart cities. Moreover, the impact of this technology in our daily lives could represent a major milestone.

  % Introduces the term security and explain briefly AAA. Information security has become one of the new trends
  The inherent pervasive characteristic of the \emph{IoT}, as well as its lack of user's consent, raises an alarm regarding the security aspects behinds its realization. These networks of thousands or even millions of interconnected autonomous devices will handle a huge amount of sensible data and it is essential that their implementations fulfill certain security requirements in order to avoid unintentional consequences. However, given the heterogeneous nature of the different elements that can conform such networks, interoperability becomes a challenge, hindering the privacy and the security of the infrastructure.

  Authentication, authorization and accounting---also known as \emph{AAA}---represent three relevant security concerns for access control of resources belonging to a network. Efforts on creating a standardized architecture for \emph{AAA} have been carried out by the \emph{Internet Engineering Task Force} and have been enforced \cite{RFC2903}, \cite{RFC2904} although implementations---specially in the \emph{IoT} context--- are still far from reaching homogeneity.
   
% Explains the motivation of this survey and its approach  
  In this survey I will carry out an evaluation of three available \emph{IoT} platforms, under different security aspects focusing on \emph{AAA}. The chosen platforms were developed as part of the \emph{Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development} of the \emph{European Commission} \cite{FP7}. The goal is to indicate if the security concerns were met and up until extent are they being enforced. Additionally, a comparison between the findings is provided. The claims included in this document are based on a theoretical approach, given that not all of the selected subjects offered open access to their source codes nor their usage.

% Outlines the structure of the paper
  This document is structured as follows: Section \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 2} defines the selected security criteria used to evaluate the chosen platforms. Section \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 3} contains the case studies. It is divided into several subsections, each of which explains the goal of a platform and the way the security concerns are dealt within. Section \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 4} summarizes the evaluation of the three subjects. Finally, section \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 5} offers a conclusion for the topic.

\section{Requirements}
  % TODO Give an explanation of security again
