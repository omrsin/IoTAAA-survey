abstract = {Emerging E-health applications utilizing \{IoT\} (Internet of Things) solutions should be sufficiently secure and robust. Adaptive security management techniques enable maintenance of sufficient security level during changing context, threats and usage scenarios. Systematic adaptive security management is based on security metrics. We analyze security objective decomposition strategies for an \{IoT\} E-health application. These strategies enable development of meaningful security metrics. Adaptive security solutions need security metrics to be able to adapt the relevant security parameters according to contextual and threat changes, which are typical for patient-centric \{IoT\} solutions used in various environments. In order to achieve this we have developed a context-aware Markov game theoretic model for security metrics risk impact assessment to measurably evaluate and validate the run-time adaptivity of \{IoT\} security solutions.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors to be connected to the Internet. By deploying intelligent low-level computational devices such as mobile phones in-between sensors and cloud servers, we can reduce data communication with the use of intelligent processing such as fusing and filtering sensor data, which saves significant amount of energy. This is also ideal for real world sensor deployments where connecting sensors directly to a computer or to the Internet is not practical. Most of the leading IoT middleware solutions require manual and labour intensive tasks to be completed in order to connect a mobile phone to them. In this paper we present a mobile application called Mobile Sensor Hub (MoSHub). It allows variety of different sensors to be connected to a mobile phone and send the data to the cloud intelligently reducing network communication. Specifically, we explore techniques that allow MoSHub to be connected to cloud based IoT middleware solutions autonomously. For our experiments, we employed Global Sensor Network (GSN) middleware to implement and evaluate our approach. Such automated configuration reduces significant amount of manual labour that need to be performed by technical experts otherwise. We also evaluated different methods that can be used to automate the configuration process.},

abstract = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a substantial acceleration of the growth rate in the future. It is also evident that the increasing number of IoT middleware solutions are developed in both research and commercial environments. However, sensor search and selection remain a critical requirement and a challenge. In this paper, we present CASSARAM, a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model for Internet of Things to address the research challenges of selecting sensors when large numbers of sensors with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available. CASSARAM proposes the search and selection of sensors based on user priorities. CASSARAM considers a broad range of characteristics of sensors for search such as reliability, accuracy, battery life just to name a few. Our approach utilises both semantic querying and quantitative reasoning techniques. User priority based weighted Euclidean distance comparison in multidimensional space technique is used to index and rank sensors. Our objectives are to highlight the importance of sensor search in IoT paradigm, identify important characteristics of both sensors and data acquisition processes which help to select sensors, understand how semantic and statistical reasoning can be combined together to address this problem in an efficient manner. We developed a tool called CASSARA to evaluate the proposed model in terms of resource consumption and response time.},

abstract = {Given the ubiquity of data on the web, and the lack of usage restriction enforcement mechanisms, stories of personal, creative and other kinds of data misuses are on the rise. There should be both sociological and technological mechanisms that facilitate accountability on the web that would prevent such data misuses. Sociological mechanisms appeal to the data consumer's self-interest in adhering to the data provider's desires. This involves a system of rewards such as recognition and financial incentives, and deterrents such as prohibitions by laws for any violations and social pressure. Bur there is no well-defined technological mechanism for the discovery of accountability or the lack of it on the web. As part of my PhD thesis I propose a solution to this problem by designing a web protocol called HTTPA (Accountable HTTP). This protocol will enable data consumers and data producers to agree to specific usage restrictions, preserve the provenance of data transferred from a web server to a client and back to another web server, and more importantly provide a mechanism to derive an `audit trail' for the data reuse with the help of a trusted intermediary called a `Provenance Tracker Network'.},
